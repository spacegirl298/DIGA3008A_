            In Pizza Eats, the dice are in charge — literally! This 2D
            roll-and-write computer game flips the script, putting your fate
            (and your pizza) in the hands of the dice. Each round, three numbers
            are rolled, and it’s up to you to use them wisely: pick your
            toppings, choose a slice, and move across the map to deliver your
            delicious creation. Strategize your moves, fill out your pizza, and
            race against your opponent to be the first to deliver hot, fresh
            slices to every house on the block. The first player to complete all
            deliveries wins — but with the dice calling the shots, anything can
            happen!

          <p>
            In Broken Bonds, step into the stitched shoes of a once-beloved
            teddy bear, torn from your rightful owner by a troubled brother and
            locked away in a room that feels more like a prison. From your
            small, plush perspective, navigate a first-person journey through
            shadows and memories as you search for a way out. Solve
            environmental puzzles and push your limits to return to the one who
            needs you most. But even once you find your way back, the journey
            isn’t over — you’ll need to mend your broken arm.

        <h2>Paintings</h2>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="Painting1.jpg"
            alt="Reproduction painting from the movie Spirited Away"
          />
          <figcaption>Spirited Away</figcaption>
          <p>
            This is a hand-painted reproduction inspired by the iconic visuals
            of Spirited Away, Studio Ghibli’s beloved animated film. Created as
            a heartfelt gift.
          </p>
          <img src="Painting2.jpg" alt="Painting of a neanderthal" />
          <figcaption>The holy Trilogy</figcaption>
          <p>
            This painting of the neanderthal is apart of a mixed-media
            installation exploring the tension and intersection between science
            and spirituality. One panel features an acrylic painting of a
            Neanderthal on glass, while another displays a pencil drawing of
            Jesus. The third side, made of plain glass, acts as a visual
            threshold. When viewed from different angles, the installation
            isolates each worldview: one side highlighting religious devotion,
            the other focusing on human evolution. But when standing at the
            midpoint between science and faith, both figures come into focus, a
            deliberate invitation to consider the coexistence of belief systems.

          />
          <figcaption>Layers of Feeling</figcaption>
          <p>
            Layers of Feeling is a portrait of a girl whose face is covered in
            thick, expressive paint — red, yellow, and green — each color
            symbolizing a distinct emotion: anger, happiness, and disgust. As
            the colors blend and bleed into one another, they form new,
            ambiguous shades that speak to the complexity of emotional
            experience. This painting captures the sensation of being
            overwhelmed, when emotions collide, overlap, and become difficult to
            separate.

        <h2>Traditional Drawings</h2>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="Drawing1.jpg"
            alt="Pencil drawing of a girl with red thread sewn into paper"
          />
          <figcaption>Stiched Silence</figcaption>
          <p>
            Stitched Silence is a mixed-media pencil drawing that explores the
            nature of overwhelming emotions. A girl, mid-scream, is frozen in a
            moment of raw expression, while her hand is being sewn to her face.
            The physical thread pierces the paper and skin alike, blurring the
            line between internal pain and external suppression.
          </p>
          <img src="Drawing2.jpg" alt="Pencil drawing of a woman" />
          <figcaption>Hands that Hold</figcaption>
          <p>
            Hands That Hold is a tribute to the quiet strength and overlooked
            presence of domestic workers. This artwork captures a moment of
            stillness, a glimpse into the life of someone whose labour often
            goes unseen but whose impact is deeply felt. This piece aims to
            restore humanity, dignity, and individuality to those whose stories
            are rarely centered.
          </p>
          <img
            src="Drawing3.jpg"
            alt="Pencil drawing of a mouth being pulled open with hands"
          />
          <figcaption>Unspoken Flesh</figcaption>
          <p>
            Unspoken Flesh confronts the tension between enforced silence and
            hypersexualization. In the artwork, a mouth is held open by forceful
            hands with drool spilling from parted lips. The artwork explores how
            women are often silenced when speaking about their own sexual
            experiences, while simultaneously being reduced to objects of
            desire.
          </p>
          <img src="Drawing4.jpg" alt="Colour pencil drawing of mouths" />
          <figcaption>Study in Expression</figcaption>
          <p>
            Study in Expression is a color pencil exploration of the mouth. Each
            set of lips, drawn in varying tones and textures, captures a
            different shapes of the mouth. Originally created as a technical
            exercise in mastering color and form, the piece naturally evolved
            into a celebration of diversity and subtle human expression.

        <h2>Digital Drawings</h2>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="DD1.png"
            alt="Digital drawing of a knight squirrel on Jack card"
          />
          <figcaption>Jacks of Squirrels</figcaption>
          <p>
            Jack of Squirrels is a digital illustration created for a card game
            of strategy and battle. This powerful card features a squirrel clad
            in detailed knight’s armor and ready for combat. This tiny warrior
            symbolizes unexpected strength and cleverness.
          </p>
          <img src="DD2.png" alt="Digital drawing of a frog smoking" />
          <figcaption>Cold-blooded Habits</figcaption>
          <p>
            Cold-Blooded Habits is a digital illustration that anthropomorphizes
            a frog dressed in a sleek jacket, smoking a ciggerate. The piece
            humorously blends human fashion and vices with the natural world,
            blurring the line between instinct and identity. The artwork invites
            viewers to reflect on how easily human behaviors can be projected
            onto the animal kingdom.
          </p>
          <img src="DD3.png" alt="Digital drawing of a man" />
          <figcaption>Caged Desires 1</figcaption>
          <p>
            Caged Desires 1 is a digital artwork created for a story which
            reimagines power dynamics and challenges traditional gender roles
            through an unsettling lens. The figure of a man stands as both a
            symbol of vulnerability and subjugation. Within the context of the
            narrative, the piece explores the objectification of men, where they
            are locked in cages, dehumanizing their bodies, and reducing them to
            mere vessels for reproduction.
          </p>
          <img src="DD4.png" alt="Digital drawing of a woman" />
          <figcaption>Caged Desires 2</figcaption>
          <p>
            Caged Desires 2 presents a striking digital image of power
            redefined. In a world where men are no longer the dominant force, a
            woman stands at the forefront, wearing a simple white cloak and
            embracing a bald head, a stark rejection of conventional beauty
            standards. The piece challenges the established norms of beauty and
            power, exploring a society where the traditionally oppressed now
            wield control.

          <figcaption>Dunford Lodge Logo</figcaption>
          <p>
            I was tasked with creating a logo for the beautiful lodge, Dunford
            Lodge. This features a bald eagle gripping a key in its beak,
            symbolizing both the freedom and security guests experience during
            their stay. The key signifies access to the natural beauty,
            serenity, and hospitality that define Dunford Lodge.
          </p>
          <img src="Logo2.jpg" alt="Logo for Canna Joint" />
          <figcaption>Canna Joint Logo</figcaption>
          <p>
            The logo for Canna Joint captures the essence of the brand,
            seamlessly blending the identity of the business with its core
            product: cannabis. After an in-depth process of reviewing various
            drafts and refining elements based on client feedback, the final
            design embodies both professionalism and approachability.
          </p>

          <figcaption>TAP MAP Logo</figcaption>
          <p>
            I was tasked with redesigning TAP MAP's logo. The redesigned logo
            incorporates the company’s core values of mining and consulting.
            Retaining the brand’s signature orange and black color scheme, the
            logo introduces key mining elements, a wheel and a pickaxe.

        <p>
          For the company Little Kickers, a company focused on introducing young
          children to the joy of soccer, I designed a playful and interactive
          calendar that doubles as a creative activity. Centered around their
          key mascots, each month features line art illustrations that children
          can colour in themselves.
