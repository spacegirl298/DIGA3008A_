          <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
          <p>
            My goal is to create a balance between readability, creativity and
            aesthetic appeal to provide and engaging user experience. I want to
            prioritize legible typography, well-structured content and intuitive
            navigation. The design will incorporate unique and engaging
            elements, to bring across the aesthetic appeal. I will focus on
            cohesive colours and balanced layouts, allowing for users to not be
            overwhelmed with information and to create a memorable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Focusing on my goal alignment and the structure of my website, I
            want it to be presented professionally and attract the right
            audiences. My target audience is for potential employers or clients.
            I want people in the animation, game design and web development
            industry to view my website as a portfolio of my work. The website
            will be a portfolio showcasing: animations, games, my process of
            developing a website, logos and information about me.

          <h2>Explaining Interface Elements</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure that I have a well-structured, visually appealing and
            user-friendly interface that aligns with my goals, I need to focus
            on the interfaceâ€™s elements. I will have a sticky navigation bar
            that will be on all pages of the website, this will have links to
            pages on the website. This will allow for easy accessibility of any
            page. I will have clear categories for all the different pages,
            allowing for users to navigate which ever page of the website that
            their heart desires. In certain parts of the website, liked design
            and blog sections, there will be a side menu where users can access
            different blogs or different subsections of the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be a footer page, which visually communicates to the user
            that this is the end of page, but also will have easily accessible
            information about me, such as my LinkedIn profile and Itch page.
          </p>
          <p>
            On certain pages of the website, it will contain buttons which
            directs users actions. On the home page there will be buttons which
            allow viewers to choose a page of the website they would like to
            explore. On the main blogs page, there will be buttons for the
            different blogs which I have written. On the individual blogs page
            and essays page, there will be a previous and next button, allowing
            for users to click between different writing pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will contain breadcrumb navigation which is a secondary
            navigation system that helps users understand their current location
            on the website and it provides links to previous pages without
            having to click the back button. If you are on a certain page, the
            breadcrumb will visually show that you are on that page, by not
            having a link to that page anymore. In the blogs and design page
            there will be a breadcrumb navigation bar, which allows you to look
            at different bogs or different pages of the design section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will contain an ID tag to the about me page. The about
            me page is located in the middle of the home page. I have added an
            ID tag, which links the user straight to where about me is. This
            allows for users to not get frustrated by being sent to the home
            page and then have to scroll to search for the about me. This link
            is in all navigations of the website.
