        <h3>Defining Visual Aesthetic</h3>
        <p>
          My website will showcase a sleek, modern and immersive look using
          blacks or rich tones for the background. There will be vibrant accent
          colours which contrast against the dark background. This contrast of
          colours, will enhance readability, ensuring that the text and UI
          remains clear. This use of colour palate showcases creativity, as the
          dark background will allow for the colourful visuals to stand out.
          This will allow for my portfolio work to stand out.
        </p>
        <h2>Fonts</h2>

          <figcaption>Fonts for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The fonts I chose are used to create effortless reading for the user.
          For the headings I have chosen to use the font, Footlight MT light,
          which has thin graceful letterforms. It gives a classic and
          professional look but adds a creative element with the curves in the
          letters. For sub-headings I have decided to go with Palatino Linotype,
          which contains a modern and classic touch to it. It is slightly
          simpler than the heading, to create a contrast between the information
          types. For paragraphs I have decided to go with Aptos (body) which is
          a highly readable, due to its simplicity in its lettering. The
          paragraphs will be the main part of the text, so I need to ensure that
          it is easily readable for users.
        </p>
        <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
        <h3>Primary Palette</h3>
        <figure>

          />
          <figcaption>Secondary palette for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Colour Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The primary palette of the website contains a variety of pastel greens
          and blues to represent the brand of the website. The background of the
          website will be a dark blue, which is contrasted by the light grey and
          pastel blue and green. The secondary colours is a range of pastel
          pinks, to add some pops of colour into the website. These colours
          contrast the blue and green tones which will be the dominant colours
          for the website.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          The composition of my website will focus on clarity, engagement and
          creative flow. The website will contain whitespace, to reduce clutter
          and make elements stand out against the dark background. To create a
          visual hierarchy, Headings will be large to stand out compared to text
          and images. There will be adequate spacing in between text to ensure
          readability.
        </p>
        <h2>Interface elements</h2>
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="Navigation.png"
            alt="navigation bar example, where it looks like a ribbon with text on it"
            width="500"
            height="100"
          />
          <figcaption>Navigation bar example</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bhewg "
            class="url"
            target="_blank"
            >https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bhewg
          </a>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation bar will contain a light grey colour with black text,
          which will create a contrast from the dark background of the website.
          The navigation will reach across the top of the page and will be shape
          like a ribbon. This will introduce the creative goal of the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Footer Page</h3>

        <p>
          The footer page will be a light grey colour, like the navigation bar,
          creating visual harmony between the start and end of the page. When
          users hover over the links in the footer, images will change the
          background of the footer. The images will match the link which they
          are hovering above.
        </p>
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          The buttons will have a rectangular boarder with rounded edges. The
          boarder is added to visualize that this is interactable. When users
          hover over buttons they will slightly increase in size, visualizing
          the button is interactable.
        </p>
        <h3>Breadcrumb Navigation</h3>
        <p>
          The navigation bar will be placed to the left of the website, allowing
          for readers to read from left to right. It will have a rectangular
          boarder with round edges, which creates visual consistency in the
          website, as the buttons contain the same boarder.
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the dark thematic feel of Steven Mengin’s website. The
          background of the website is black, and there are pops of colour in
          the images. I will incorporate this into my website, but I would want
          to add more colour, in text and in icons. In this website, you have
          cursor which changes into an arrow when you hover over images,
          allowing you to switch between images. I like the idea of adding in
          creative elements and I will explore adding more creative elements
          like this. At the footer of the website, if you hover certain texts,
          the background image changes. This is creative idea, which I will
          implement into the website, as it aligns with my goal of creativity.
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In this website, it continues with the dark aesthetic and pops of
          colour which I want to incorporate into my website. As you are
          scrolling through the website, the text and images fade onto the
          screen. This is something I would like to add to my website, it is
          creative. When the text fades in, its stays static allowing for users
          to read the information. This creates a balance between creativity and
          readability.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I was inspired by the clean and professional look of the website. The
          website contains a lot of creative elements in its art and layout but
          still contains a minimalistic style which doesn’t overwhelm the user
          with information.
