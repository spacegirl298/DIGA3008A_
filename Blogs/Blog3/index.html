          <h3>User Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            My goal for my website is for easy readability and to have a lot of
            creative elements. I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing,
            but with an organized clean look. I want to find a balance between
            creativity and readability, where the creativity doesnâ€™t take away
            from the readability. I want this website to be a portfolio of all
            my work and a representation of my abilities in web design. I want
            my users to be able to easily navigate the website. My target
            audience is for people in the web development, game design and
            animation industry. I want to be able to share this portfolio when
            applying for jobs, as it will be a portfolio of all my work. People
            in the industry would wan to be able to easily see my work, without
            unnecessary information being on the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Mapping out of Sites Content</h3>

            <img
              src="ContentsDgs.png"
              alt="Diagram of Contents of the website"
              width="450"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>Diagram of the contents of the website</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The content of the website will be my blogs, art, animations, games
            and describing the website. The most important thing of the website
            is showing all the content in a readable way. The most interesting
            thing of the website will be the creative elements of it. What I
            mean by creative elements, is that the website will be designed with
            colours and different shapes.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            A good URL scheme improves a website Search Engine Optimization,
            which improves a websites visibility in the search engine. A good
            URL scheme should be descriptive and structured hierarchically, this
            allows for good usability and navigation. With semantic markups,
            allows the content to be meaningful and ensures that it is readable
            to the computer. With the use of sections, headers and articles will
            enhance accessibility and improve SEO.
